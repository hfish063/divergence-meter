# Pomodoro Timer

## About
This application serves as a Steins;Gate themed Pomodoro timer.  I use the Pomodoro method *at all times* when I study, or perform work-related tasks.  Based off this, I thought it would be fun to make this simple application, as it would be a tool I could actually utilize rather often.

**What is "Pomodoro"?**
- Pomodoro is a highly popular study technique, where an individual divides their work between focus sessions and breaks.  Read more [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique).

I decided to develop it as a desktop application, based on the Java Swing library, as it is extremely easy to use, and has been included in the JDK for quite some time now.  Obviously, Swing is seldom used in the real world today, but it does share many features in common with other popular GUI tools.
